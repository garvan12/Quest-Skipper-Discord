# Steps how to do it 
1. Download and open the Skipper.txt
2. copy the hole script from the skipper.txt
3. Open Discord > press ``Ctrl + Shift + i`` >> select a quest you want to use it on
4. go to Console second top bar
**Dislaimer:** if you cant paste the script first try typing "allow pasting" in the console
5. paste the Skipper.txt inside the Console
6. wait for the quest to get complete
7. claim your reward
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**If  its video the Quest will be Insta done / if its game you have to wait 15 mins to complete the quest.**
>> why 15 mins wait and not insta like the video?
>> the games are more complex with the API once discord catch you doing a game quest insta they will get suspicous and might ban your account
>> this allows the user using the script to be safe from ban (most time )

# its not 100% that your account will get banned use at your OWN risk!
